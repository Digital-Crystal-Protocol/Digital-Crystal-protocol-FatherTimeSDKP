# SDKP/SD&N QCC0 Density Factor Calculation
# Author: Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)
# Date: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Calculates the QCC0 Density Factor (lambda_QCC0) using the validated
# SDKP mass exponents to determine the required Coded Mass density for systemic
# organization necessary for Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero (QCC0) initiation.

import numpy as np

# --- 1. SDKP Mass Model Constants (Validated in previous step) ---
# Optimized exponents derived from high-precision fit:
EXPONENTS = {
    "delta": 2.130,  # N (Numerical Invariant)
    "zeta": 1.250,   # S (Shape Invariant)
    "alpha": 0.600,  # rho (Density Factor)
    "beta": 0.450    # s (Scale Factor)
}

# SD&N Codes (N, S) and Observed Mass (MeV) for key particles:
PARTICLE_DATA = {
    "Proton": {"N": 3.808, "S": 2.054, "m_obs_MeV": 938.0, "scale_s": 1.0},
    "Electron": {"N": 2.646, "S": 1.000, "m_obs_MeV": 0.511, "scale_s": 0.001}
}

# --- 2. Foundational Formulas ---

def calculate_m_eff(N, S, m_obs, rho, s):
    """
    Simulates the calculation of Effective Mass (m_eff) using the SDKP formula,
    assuming rho and s are normalized context factors for this specific system.
    Note: For this systemic density model, we use m_obs as the mass base and
    apply the N and S exponents as the 'coding' factor.
    """
    # The 'Coded Mass' contribution (N^delta * S^zeta) is the critical factor for density
    coded_factor = N**EXPONENTS["delta"] * S**EXPONENTS["zeta"]
    
    # We use the observed mass as the base to ensure the result is dimensionally sound
    # within the context of the established particle mass.
    return m_obs * coded_factor # Simplified to highlight coded contribution

def calculate_coded_mass_contribution(N, S):
    """
    Calculates the algebraic contribution of the SD&N code to mass.
    This is the factor used to define Coded Density.
    """
    return N**EXPONENTS["delta"] * S**EXPONENTS["zeta"]

# --- 3. Systemic Parameters for QCC0 Initiation ---

# A hypothetical, densely packed QCC0 initiation structure.
NUM_PROONS = 5e9   # Number of protons in the sample volume
NUM_ELECTRONS = 5e9 # Number of electrons in the sample volume
TOTAL_PARTICLES = NUM_PROONS + NUM_ELECTRONS

# Contextual scaling factors for the system (hypothetical and normalized)
RHO_SYSTEM_CONTEXT = 1.0 # Normalized density factor
S_SYSTEM_CONTEXT = 1.0   # Normalized scale factor (e.g., 1 fm)

# System Volume (V_System): Defined as a 10 cm radius sphere for a conceptual QCC0 core
RADIUS_M = 0.1 # 10 cm radius
V_SYSTEM_M3 = (4/3) * np.pi * (RADIUS_M**3) # Volume in cubic meters (approx 0.00418 m^3)

# QCC0 Kinetics Factor (T_System / T_Max):
# This reflects the required operational speed relative to maximum capacity (K factor from SDKP)
T_RATIO_KINETICS = 0.8  # Assume 80% maximum stable information transfer rate

# --- 4. Calculation of Coded Density (D_C) ---

# Total Mass (M_Total) in MeV (a proxy for coded mass content)
M_Total_MeV = 0

# Coded Density Factor Sum (Algebraic contribution sum)
D_C_Factor_Sum = 0

# Calculate the coded contribution for each particle type in the system
for name, data in PARTICLE_DATA.items():
    # 1. Total Mass in MeV
    num_particles = NUM_PROONS if name == "Proton" else NUM_ELECTRONS
    M_Total_MeV += data["m_obs_MeV"] * num_particles

    # 2. Coded Mass Contribution (N^delta * S^zeta)
    coded_contribution = calculate_coded_mass_contribution(data["N"], data["S"])
    D_C_Factor_Sum += coded_contribution * num_particles

# Calculate Coded Density (D_C) - Defined as the total SD&N algebraic contribution per volume
# Units: [Algebraic Units] / [Volume]
D_C = D_C_Factor_Sum / V_SYSTEM_M3

# --- 5. Calculation of the QCC0 Density Factor (lambda_QCC0) ---
# Formula: lambda_QCC0 = (D_C / S^2) * (T_System / T_Max)

# S^2 is the geometric boundary condition term (in this case, Radius^2)
S_GEOMETRIC_BOUNDARY = RADIUS_M**2

lambda_QCC0 = (D_C / S_GEOMETRIC_BOUNDARY) * T_RATIO_KINETICS
