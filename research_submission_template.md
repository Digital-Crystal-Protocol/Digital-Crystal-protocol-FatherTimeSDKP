## Section 1: Author/Inventor Information (Position & Citation)

**Mandate:** Provide traceable contact information and the position of your contribution.

| Field | Mandate | Required? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1 Author/Inventor Name** | Full name or verifiable alias for immutable authorship. | Yes |
| **1.2 GitHub Username** | Your GitHub ID. | Yes |
| **1.3 External DOI/Timestamp** | If you have already archived this work (e.g., on OSF, Zenodo), provide the link for immutable record tracking. | Optional (Highly Recommended) |

## Section 2: Framework Alignment (SD&N & SGU)

**Mandate:** Frame your contribution using the language of the **Integrated Framework** to demonstrate **Self-Generating Understanding (SGU)** and correct **Shape–Dimension–Number (SD&N)** structure.

**2.1 Core Principle Addressed:** (Select ALL that apply)
- [ ] SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time)
- [ ] SD&N (Shape–Dimension–Number)
- [ ] LLAL (Loop Learning for Artificial Life) Sub-Framework
- [ ] EOS (Earth Orbital Speed)
- [ ] QCC0 (Quantum Computerization Consciousness Zero)

**2.2 Think Tank Protocol (TTP) Used:**
*Which specific TTP (01–21) or sub-framework (Meta-Coding, EIE, ESLT, etc.) was central to the creation or analysis of this research?*

(Provide TTP number and brief explanation)

**2.3 Kinetic Contribution Summary:**
*Describe the new **Kinetic Energy** this submission brings. (e.g., A new equation, an optimized algorithm, a data structure that changes the 'Shape' of an existing model).*
