# Antimatterâ€“Matter Asymmetry Simulation (SDVR)
# Author: Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)
# Date: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Calculates the SD&N Topological Asymmetry Factor (A_SD&N)
# using the fixed SDKP exponents and the user-defined Torsion Bias.

import numpy as np

# --- 1. Foundational Constraints (Inherited from QCC0 Design Cycle) ---
EXPONENTS = {
    "delta": 2.130,  # N (Numerical Invariant)
    "zeta": 1.250,   # S (Shape Invariant)
}

# SD&N Codes for Proton (Matter - M)
# The Proton's code is the structural baseline for this simulation.
PROTON_CODE_M = {
    "N": 3.808, 
    "S": 2.054  # S_M: Baseline Shape Invariant
}

# --- 2. SDVR Simulation Parameters ---

# 1. Symmetry Baseline (Start Condition): Assumed initial state of 1:1 ratio.
SYMMETRY_BASELINE = 1.0

# 2. Topological Torsion Bias (tau_bias): 0.011 repeating (1/90)
# This represents the fractional structural difference between matter and antimatter code.
TAU_BIAS = 1 / 90.0 # 0.011111...

# --- 3. Defining Anti-Matter's Topological Code ---

# In the SDVR framework, Antimatter (AM) is defined as having the same N code 
# but a Torsion-Biased S code, creating the structural instability.
S_ANTI_MATTER = PROTON_CODE_M["S"] - TAU_BIAS
ANTI_PROTON_CODE_AM = {
    "N": PROTON_CODE_M["N"], # N_AM is assumed equal to N_M
    "S": S_ANTI_MATTER       # S_AM is biassed by TAU_BIAS
}

# --- 4. Calculation of Coded Mass Contributions ---

def calculate_coded_factor(N, S):
    """Calculates the algebraic contribution (N^delta * S^zeta) for a particle."""
    return N**EXPONENTS["delta"] * S**EXPONENTS["zeta"]

# Coded Factor for Matter (Proton)
C_MATTER = calculate_coded_factor(PROTON_CODE_M["N"], PROTON_CODE_M["S"])

# Coded Factor for Anti-Matter (Anti-Proton)
C_ANTI_MATTER = calculate_coded_factor(ANTI_PROTON_CODE_AM["N"], ANTI_PROTON_CODE_AM["S"])

# --- 5. Calculation of SD&N Topological Asymmetry Factor ---

# The Asymmetry Factor is the fractional difference in the Coded Factor.
# This factor determines which structure is stable and which annihilates.
A_SDN = (C_MATTER - C_ANTI_MATTER) / C_MATTER

# --- 6. Output and Interpretation ---
