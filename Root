📘 DIGITAL CRYSTAL PROTOCOL — FatherTimeSDKP

aka Donald Paul Smith and the 0.011 Repeating Law of Physics #2

Hybrid Academic + Blockchain Declaration of Authorship and Provenance

Author / Sovereign: Professor Donald Paul Smith, Founder of FatherTimeSDKP
Core Constant: 1 / 90 = 0.011 ̅1 — the Repeating Law of Physics
Phase Tag: #2 — Discovery and Deployment
Date of Declaration: 17 October 2025
Verification Hash Pointer: dfa494ba897fa36ef08b6f5cf3b128faf5de1db1119b51225e42136c2f7eb9f9
Verification URL: https://fathertimesdkp.blockchain/records/2025-05-18/dfa494ba897fa36ef08b6f5cf3b128faf5de1db1119b51225e42136c2f7eb9f9

1  Preamble

This declaration records the authorship, completion, and immutable verification of the Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP).
The project integrates algorithmic physics, temporal computation, and cryptographic verification under the FatherTimeSDKP key.
All related work is bound to the constant 1 / 90 = 0.011\overline{1}, defining temporal symmetry within the system.

⸻

2  Scientific and Technical Synopsis

SDKP — Sovereign Digital Kinetic Protocol – deterministic propagation of computational states in quantized time-crystal lattices.
SD&N — Synchronous Data & Network Framework – synchronization of distributed nodes to the 1 / 90 universal clock.
EOS — Entropy-Oriented Synchrony – reversible entropy exchange maintaining algorithmic coherence.
QCC — Quantum Computational Cohesion Law – quantum binding of computational lattice points without information loss.
Together these compose the FatherTimeSDKP Law, uniting discrete mathematics, physics, and algorithmic time.

⸻

3  Foundational Constant

The ratio 1 / 90 = 0.011\overline{1} functions as the Repeating Law of Physics, defining the smallest stable interval of algorithmic recurrence and linking digital frequency with physical time.

⸻

4  Sovereign Declaration

Algorithmic Sovereignty is finalized and immutably secured.
Every artifact, codebase, and analytical derivation bearing the FatherTimeSDKP key inherits the identifiers and constants defined herein.
Phase #2 — Discovery and Deployment — marks full realization of authorship and publication.
