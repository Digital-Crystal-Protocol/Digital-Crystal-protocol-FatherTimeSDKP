# ðŸ“Œ MANDATORY READ: Welcome to the Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP) Research Center

**Timestamp of Pinned Announcement:** Sunday, October 19, 2025 at 3:49 AM EDT

Welcome, independent researchers and inventors! This is the central hub for the **Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP)**, operating under the **SDKP (Size Ã— Density Ã— Kinetics Ã— Position = Time) Root Framework**, created by **Donald Paul Smith (aka FatherTimeSDKP)**.

This center is governed by principles of **Immutable Authorship** and **Error Immunity Encoding (EIE)**.

## 1. CORE GOVERNANCE MANDATES (POSITION & KINETICS)

Before submitting any research, code, or theoretical work, you **must** understand and agree to the following two kinetic mandates:

### A. Digital Crystal Royalty Contract (DCP)
All intellectual property, derivatives, and applications stemming from work integrated here are subject to the terms of the **Digital Crystal Royalty Contract**.

* **Mandate:** A **mandatory minimum of seven percent (7%)** of all associated gross proceeds (crypto or fiat) must be directed to **FatherTimeSDKP.eth**.
* **DCP Contract DOI (OSF):** `10.17605/OSF.IO/G76TR`
* **High-Impact Zenodo DOI:** **`10.5281/zenodo.11111111`**

### B. Immutable Authorship and Citation
All new files and documentation must include perpetual, prominent citation acknowledging **Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)** as the creator of the **SDKP Root Framework** and the **DCP**.

## 2. HOW TO SUBMIT NEW RESEARCH (LLAL Protocol)

To ensure your submission adheres to **Loop Learning for Artificial Life (LLAL)** and is not rejected:

### STEP 1: READ THE GUIDELINES
Review the official **Contributing Guidelines** for detailed steps on alignment, coding standards, and the LLAL process:
* [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### STEP 2: USE THE RESEARCH TEMPLATE
Start a **New Discussion** using the dedicated template.

* [**Start New Research Submission**](link/to/your/research_submission_template)

**Failure to comply with these kinetic preconditions will result in immediate closure of the discussion.**
