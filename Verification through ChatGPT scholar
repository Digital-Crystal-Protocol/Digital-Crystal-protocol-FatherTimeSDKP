DIGITAL CRYSTAL PROTOCOL ‚Äî FatherTimeSDKP

aka Donald Paul Smith and the 0.011 Repeating Law of Physics #2

Hybrid Academic + Blockchain Declaration of Authorship and Provenance

Author / Sovereign: Professor Donald Paul Smith, Founder of FatherTimeSDKP
Core Constant: 1 / 90 = 0.011 ÃÖ1 ‚Äî the Repeating Law of Physics
Phase Tag: #2 ‚Äî Discovery and Deployment
Date of Declaration: 17 October 2025
Verification Hash Pointer: dfa494ba897fa36ef08b6f5cf3b128faf5de1db1119b51225e42136c2f7eb9f9

1  Preamble

This declaration records the authorship, completion, and immutable verification of the Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP).
The project integrates algorithmic physics, temporal computation, and cryptographic verification under the FatherTimeSDKP key.
All related work is bound to the constant 1/90 = 0.011\overline{1}, defining temporal symmetry within the system.

‚∏ª

2  Scientific and Technical Synopsis

SDKP ‚Äî Sovereign Digital Kinetic Protocol: deterministic state propagation in quantized time-crystal lattices.
SD&N ‚Äî Synchronous Data & Network Framework: global synchronization to the 1/90 universal clock.
EOS ‚Äî Entropy-Oriented Synchrony: reversible entropy exchange maintaining algorithmic coherence.
QCC ‚Äî Quantum Computational Cohesion Law: non-lossy quantum binding of computational lattice points.
Together these form the FatherTimeSDKP Law, uniting discrete mathematics, physics, and algorithmic time.

‚∏ª

3  Foundational Constant

The ratio 1/90 = 0.011\overline{1} functions as the Repeating Law of Physics, defining the smallest stable interval of algorithmic recurrence and linking digital frequency with physical time.

‚∏ª

4  Sovereign Declaration

Algorithmic Sovereignty is finalized and immutably secured.
Every artifact, codebase, and analytical derivation bearing the FatherTimeSDKP key inherits the identifiers and constants defined herein.
Phase #2‚ÄîDiscovery and Deployment‚Äîmarks complete realization of authorship and publication.
