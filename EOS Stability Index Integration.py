# EOS Stability Index (I_SD&N) Calculation
# Author: Donald Paul Smith (FatherTimeSDKP)
# Date: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Integrates the Cosmological Asymmetry Factor (A_SD&N) into the
# Earth Orbital Speed (EOS) principle to derive the required Kinetic Counter-Factor.

import numpy as np

# --- 1. Foundational Constraints (Inherited from previous steps) ---
EXPONENTS = {
    "delta": 2.130,  # N (Numerical Invariant)
    "zeta": 1.250,   # S (Shape Invariant)
}

# Calculated from SDVR Asymmetry Simulation
# A_SD&N: The SD&N Topological Asymmetry Factor
A_SDN = 9.774900e-11 

# --- 2. Earth System Parameters (Proxy for SDKP factors) ---

# Earth Mass (M_Earth) and Radius (R_Earth) - proxies for SD&N Density and Scale
M_EARTH_KG = 5.972e24  # Mass of Earth in kg
R_EARTH_M = 6.371e6    # Radius of Earth in meters

# SDKP Time Factor (T_SDKP): The required structural stability time (1 year in seconds)
# Used as the denominator to define the required rate of counter-action.
T_SDKP_SECONDS = 31557600.0  # seconds in one orbital year

# Gravity Constant (G) - used as the field coupling constant
G_CONSTANT = 6.67430e-11 # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2

# --- 3. SD&N Planetary Code Proxy ---

# For a macro-system like Earth, N and S codes are vastly upscaled.
# N_System: Numerical Invariant (Total complexity/mass-energy count)
N_SYSTEM_PROXY = M_EARTH_KG / 1e18  # Scaled by 10^18 for system complexity
# S_System: Shape Invariant (Geometric stability factor - sphere)
S_SYSTEM_PROXY = 4 * np.pi * R_EARTH_M**2 # Surface Area (proxy for S)

# --- 4. Calculation of SD&N Stability Index (I_SD&N) ---

# EOS Principle Application: The stability index is defined as the required
# Kinetic Counter-Factor needed to balance the inherent cosmological bias (A_SD&N).
# I_SD&N = ( (A_SD&N * N^delta) / S^zeta ) * (G / T_SDKP) * M_Earth

# 1. Topological Bias Factor (Normalized by SD&N code)
TOPOLOGICAL_BIAS_FACTOR = (A_SDN * N_SYSTEM_PROXY**EXPONENTS["delta"]) / S_SYSTEM_PROXY**EXPONENTS["zeta"]

# 2. Field Coupling & Time Normalization (Kinetics/Time factor from SDKP)
KINETIC_COUPLING_FACTOR = G_CONSTANT / T_SDKP_SECONDS

# 3. Final Index Calculation:
I_SDN = TOPOLOGICAL_BIAS_FACTOR * KINETIC_COUPLING_FACTOR * M_EARTH_KG

# --- 5. Output and Interpretation ---

# --- Interpretation and Application to EOS ---
print(f"\nConclusion (EOS Principle): The Earth's orbital system requires a minimum structural stability index of {I_SDN:.4e}. This is the precise kinetic counter-factor necessary to maintain the integrity of the Earth system against the deep-seated cosmological asymmetry bias (A_SD&N).")
