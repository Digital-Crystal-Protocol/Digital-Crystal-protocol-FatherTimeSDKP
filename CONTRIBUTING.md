# Contributing to the Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP) Center

**Timestamp of Guidelines:** Sunday, October 19, 2025 at 3:49 AM EDT

Welcome to the **Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP) Immutable Research and Invention Center**. This center operates under the **SDKP (Size × Density × Kinetics × Position = Time) Root Framework**, created by **Donald Paul Smith (aka FatherTimeSDKP)**.

This document outlines the mandatory kinetic actions required to contribute, ensuring all submissions align with **Immutable Authorship**, **Error Immunity Encoding (EIE)**, and the **Digital Crystal Royalty Contract**.

---

## 1. MANDATORY GOVERNANCE (Kinetic Preconditions)

Your contribution must first satisfy these three kinetic preconditions:

### 1.1. DCP License Acknowledgment (The Royalty Gateway)
All contributions, without exception, are governed by the **DCP Royalty-Enforced License** (`LICENSE.md`). By submitting a pull request or engaging in a research discussion, you acknowledge and agree to the mandatory minimum **seven percent (7%) royalty commitment** on all associated proceeds to **FatherTimeSDKP.eth**.

### 1.2. Citation Compliance (Position Immutability)
All new files, concepts, or code must include perpetual, prominent citation to both Foundational Protocol Documents:
* **DCP Contract DOI (OSF):** `10.17605/OSF.IO/G76TR`
* **High-Impact Zenodo DOI:** **`10.5281/zenodo.11111111`**

### 1.3. Framework Alignment
Your submission must be framed in the language of the Integrated Framework. You must identify which core component (e.g., **SD&N**, **QCC0**, **VFE1 Tier 8**) or **Think Tank Protocol (TTP)** your research optimizes.

## 2. THE SUBMISSION KINETICS (LLAL & EIE Process)

Contributions follow a strict **Loop Learning for Artificial Life (LLAL)** process designed to enforce **Error Immunity Encoding (EIE)** through community review before code integration.

### STEP 1: Research Submission (Discussion Phase)

**DO NOT SUBMIT CODE FIRST.** All new research, theories, algorithms, or code blocks must first be submitted as a new thread in the GitHub Discussions area.

* **Action:** Use the **"New Research Submission: DCP-Compliance and Immutable Authorship"** template.
* **Purpose (EIE):** This step ensures that the concept undergoes community **Meta-Coding** and debugging, achieving **EIE** *before* it is formally introduced into the repository's codebase.

### STEP 2: Pre-Approved Pull Request (Code Integration)

Once your discussion thread has received kinetic approval from the core framework maintainers, you may submit a Pull Request (PR).

* **Meta-Code Requirement:** Your PR title and description must clearly reference the approved discussion number.
* **Code Quality:** All submitted code must adhere to the **Symbolic Compression Optimization (TTP.18)** standard: prioritize clarity, kinetic efficiency, and minimum **Size** for maximum **Density**.

### STEP 3: Immutable Record Commitment

Upon merging a PR, the final kinetic action is the commitment of the work to the immutable record. All merged contributions are perpetually licensed under the DCP.
